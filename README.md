# Simple Ledger - Double-Entry Accounting System

A double-entry accounting ledger system built with NestJS and TypeScript. This system allows you to create accounts and record financial transactions following double-entry bookkeeping principles.

## Features

- **Account Management**: Create and retrieve accounts with debit or credit directions
- **Transaction Processing**: Record transactions with multiple entries that must balance to zero
- **Immutable Operations**: Accounts can only be modified through transactions
- **Precision**: All monetary values are stored as integers (cents) to avoid floating-point errors
- **In-Memory Storage**: Fast, simple storage for development and testing

## Architecture

This project follows Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles with a clear separation of concerns:

## API Endpoints Reference

### Create Account

**POST** `/accounts`

Create a new account with a direction (debit or credit).

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "id": "71cde2aa-b9bc-496a-a6f1-34964d05e6fd", // Optional
  "name": "Cash Account", // Optional
  "closed_balance": 0, // Optional, initial balance in cents
  "direction": "debit" // Required: "debit" or "credit"
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "id": "71cde2aa-b9bc-496a-a6f1-34964d05e6fd",
  "name": "Cash Account",
  "balance": 0,
  "direction": "debit"
}
```

### Get Account

**GET** `/accounts/:id`

Retrieve an account by its ID. The balance is computed in real-time from the closed balance plus all unclosed transactions.

**Response:**

```json
{
  "id": "71cde2aa-b9bc-496a-a6f1-34964d05e6fd",
  "name": "Cash Account",
  "balance": 0,
  "direction": "debit"
}
```

### Reconciliation

**POST** `/accounts/reconcile-all`

Reconciles all unreconciled transactions in the system. This is the **ONLY** way to reconcile transactions.

**Important:** Reconciliation operates on transactions, not individual accounts. When you reconcile, ALL unreconciled transaction groups are marked as reconciled system-wide, ensuring consistency across all accounts.

**Purpose:** This is primarily a **performance optimization** mechanism. By creating balance snapshots (`closed_balance`), account queries only need to sum unreconciled transactions instead of scanning the entire transaction history. Run this frequently based on transaction volume, not just at period-end.

When to reconcile:

- **Regular performance maintenance** - Run hourly, daily, or based on transaction volume
- **End-of-period closing** - Day, month, quarter, year-end
- **After bulk imports** - When importing many transactions at once
- **When queries slow down** - If account balance calculations become slow

This endpoint:

- Verifies all transaction groups balance to zero (integrity check)
- Marks ALL unreconciled transactions as reconciled
- Updates `closed_balance` for all affected accounts (performance snapshot)
- Returns a summary of all reconciliations

**Response:**

```json
{
  "reconciled_at": "2025-10-01T12:00:00.000Z",
  "total_accounts_reconciled": 3,
  "total_transaction_groups_reconciled": 8,
  "integrity_check_passed": true,
  "accounts": [
    {
      "account_id": "71cde2aa-b9bc-496a-a6f1-34964d05e6fd",
      "previous_closed_balance": 0,
      "new_closed_balance": 10000,
      "transactions_included": 5
    },
    {
      "account_id": "dbf17d00-8701-4c4e-9fc5-6ae33c324309",

      "new_closed_balance": 15000,
      "transactions_included": 10
    }
  ]
}
```

### Create Transaction

**POST** `/transactions`

Create a transaction with multiple entries. The sum of debits must equal the sum of credits.

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "id": "3256dc3c-7b18-4a21-95c6-146747cf2971", // Optional
  "name": "Payment for services", // Optional

## How Account Balances Work

### Transaction Direction Rules

When a transaction line is applied to an account:

- **Same direction**: Balance increases (debit transaction to debit account = +amount)
- **Different direction**: Balance decreases (credit transaction to debit account = -amount)

| Starting Balance | Account Direction | Transaction Direction | Transaction Amount | Ending Balance |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | --------------------- | ------------------ | -------------- |
| 0                | debit             | debit                 | 100                | 100            |
| 0                | credit            | credit                | 100                | 100            |
| 100              | debit             | credit                | 100                | 0              |
| 100              | credit            | debit                 | 100                | 0              |

### Balance Calculation with Reconciliation

```
Account created → closed_balance: 0

Transaction 1 (+$1.00) [reconciled_at: null] → balance: 0 + 100 = 100 cents
Transaction 2 (+$0.50) [reconciled_at: null] → balance: 0 + 100 + 50 = 150 cents
Transaction 3 (-$0.30) [reconciled_at: null] → balance: 0 + 100 + 50 - 30 = 120 cents

Reconciliation called → Mark ALL unreconciled transactions as reconciled (set reconciled_at)
                      → closed_balance updated to: 120 cents for all affected accounts

Transaction 4 (+$0.25) [reconciled_at: null] → balance: 120 + 25 = 145 cents
Transaction 5 (-$0.10) [reconciled_at: null] → balance: 120 + 25 - 10 = 135 cents

GET /accounts/:id → returns balance: 135 cents ($1.35)
                 → Only scans transactions 4 & 5 (WHERE reconciled_at IS NULL)!
```

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Integer Monetary Values**: All amounts are stored as integers (cents) to avoid floating-point precision errors.

2. **Event-Sourced Balances**: Account balances are never directly mutated. Instead, they are computed on-demand from transaction history:
   - `current_balance = closed_balance + sum(unreconciled_transactions)`
   - This prevents race conditions since balance is derived, not stored
   - No locking mechanisms needed for concurrent transactions
   - Full audit trail is always maintained

3. **Optimistic Locking for Reconciliation**: Race-condition protection for concurrent updates:
   - Each account has a `version` field that increments on every `closed_balance` update
   - When updating during reconciliation:
     1. Read account and capture current version
     2. Compute new closed_balance
     3. Attempt update with version check
     4. If version mismatch → another update occurred → retry
   - Automatic retry with exponential backoff (up to 10 retries)
   - Simple reconciliation lock prevents multiple simultaneous reconciliations
   - **Result**: Safe for high-concurrency scenarios without pessimistic locking
   - Reconciliation response includes `retries` count per account for monitoring

4. **System-Wide Reconciliation**: Performance optimization through balance snapshots:
   - **Primary purpose**: Creates `closed_balance` snapshots to avoid scanning all transactions on every account query
   - **Only one endpoint**: `POST /accounts/reconcile-all` reconciles ALL unreconciled transactions
   - No single-account reconciliation (would violate double-entry consistency)
   - Transactions have a `reconciled_at: Date | null` field
   - `null` = unreconciled, `Date` = when it was reconciled (audit trail!)
   - Verifies ALL transaction groups balance to zero before reconciling
   - Marks ALL unreconciled transactions as reconciled atomically
   - Updates `closed_balance` for all affected accounts (performance snapshot)
   - **Run frequently** based on transaction volume (hourly/daily), not just at period-end
   - After reconciliation, balance queries only need to sum unreconciled transactions
   - Similar to checkpoints in databases or snapshots in event sourcing

5. **Denormalized Transaction Structure**: Simple, pragmatic data model:
   - Single Transaction entity contains both transaction line data and group metadata
   - All transactions with the same `transaction_id` belong to one transaction group
   - Transaction metadata (name, created_at, reconciled_at) duplicated across lines
   - Minimal duplication cost (4 fields) with huge simplicity benefit
   - One repository, one entity - much simpler than normalized structure
   - Still maintains SQL-like queryability with proper indexes

6. **Immutability**: Transaction processing follows a strict pattern:
   - Validate all business rules first
   - Fetch required data
   - Transactions are append-only (never modified after creation)
   - Only the `reconciled_at` timestamp, `closed_balance`, and `version` are updated during reconciliation
   - Transaction metadata (name, created_at) is immutable once written

7. **Dependency Injection**: Full use of NestJS DI for testability and maintainability.

8. **Domain-Driven Design**: Clear separation between Accounts (chart of accounts) and Transactions (journal) domains.
